12526810	Molecular and functional profiling of memory CD8 T cell differentiation.	Kaech Susan M, Hemby Scott, Kersh Ellen, Ahmed Rafi	How and when memory T cells form during an immune response are long-standing questions. To better understand memory CD8 T cell development, a time course of gene expression and functional changes in antigen-specific T cells during viral infection was evaluated. The expression of many genes continued to change after viral clearance in accordance with changes in CD8 T cell functional properties. Even though memory cell precursors were present at the peak of the immune response, these cells did not display hallmark functional traits of memory T cells. However, these cells gradually acquired the memory cell qualities of self-renewal and rapid recall to antigen suggesting the model that antigen-specific CD8 T cells progressively differentiate into memory cells following viral infection.
18275831	Combined deficiency of proapoptotic regulators Bim and Fas results in the early onset of systemic autoimmunity.	Hutcheson Jack, Scatizzi John C, Siddiqui Akbar M, Haines G Kenneth, Wu Tianfu, Li Quan-Zhen, Davis Laurie S, Mohan Chandra, Perlman Harris	Alterations in the stoichiometric balance between members of Bcl-2 and Fas apoptotic pathway could lead to the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). We showed that patients with SLE displayed increased expression in antiapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 and Fas apoptotic pathways in isolated mononuclear cells. Further, mice (Bcl2l11(-/-)Fas(lpr/lpr)) lacking the Bcl-2 pro-apoptotic member, Bim (Bcl2l11(-/-)) and and with an lpr mutation in the gene encoding Fas (Fas(lpr/lpr)) developed severe SLE-like disease by 16 weeks of age unlike Bcl2l11(-/-) or Fas(lpr/lpr) mice. Bcl2l11(-/-)Fas(lpr/lpr) antigen-presenting cells (APCs) were markedly activated, and their numbers were increased in lymphoid tissues and in kidneys, yet numerous TUNEL-positive cells were observed in glomeruli of Bcl2l11(-/-)Fas(lpr/lpr) mice. These data demonstrate that dysregulation of the Bcl-2 or Fas pathways can alter the function of APCs, thereby leading to SLE pathogenesis.
27851914	Transcriptional Landscape of Human Tissue Lymphocytes Unveils Uniqueness of Tumor-Infiltrating T Regulatory Cells.	De Simone Marco, Arrigoni Alberto, Rossetti Grazisa, Gruarin Paola, Ranzani Valeria, Politano Claudia, Bonnal Raoul J P, Provasi Elena, Sarnicola Maria Lucia, Panzeri Ilaria, Moro Monica, Crosti Mariacristina, Mazzara Saveria, Vaira Valentina, Bosari Silvano, Palleschi Alessandro, Santambrogio Luigi, Bovo Giorgio, Zucchini Nicola, Totis Mauro, Gianotti Luca, Cesana Giancarlo, Perego Roberto A, Maroni Nirvana, Pisani Ceretti Andrea, Opocher Enrico, De Francesco Raffaele, Geginat Jens, Stunnenberg Hendrik G, Abrignani Sergio, Pagani Massimiliano	Tumor-infiltrating regulatory T lymphocytes (Treg) can suppress effector T cells specific for tumor antigens. Deeper molecular definitions of tumor-infiltrating-lymphocytes could thus offer therapeutic opportunities. Transcriptomes of T helper 1 (Th1), Th17, and Treg cells infiltrating colorectal or non-small-cell lung cancers were compared to transcriptomes of the same subsets from normal tissues and validated at the single-cell level. We found that tumor-infiltrating Treg cells were highly suppressive, upregulated several immune-checkpoints, and expressed on the cell surfaces specific signature molecules such as interleukin-1 receptor 2 (IL1R2), programmed death (PD)-1 Ligand1, PD-1 Ligand2, and CCR8 chemokine, which were not previously described on Treg cells. Remarkably, high expression in whole-tumor samples of Treg cell signature genes, such as LAYN, MAGEH1, or CCR8, correlated with poor prognosis. Our findings provide insights into the molecular identity and functions of human tumor-infiltrating Treg cells and define potential targets for tumor immunotherapy.
20605485	Tumor-induced tolerance and immune suppression depend on the C/EBPbeta transcription factor.	Marigo Ilaria, Bosio Erika, Solito Samantha, Mesa Circe, Fernandez Audry, Dolcetti Luigi, Ugel Stefano, Sonda Nada, Bicciato Silvio, Falisi Erika, Calabrese Fiorella, Basso Giuseppe, Zanovello Paola, Cozzi Emanuele, Mandruzzato Susanna, Bronte Vincenzo	Tumor growth is associated with a profound alteration in myelopoiesis, leading to recruitment of immunosuppressive cells known as myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). We showed that among factors produced by various experimental tumors, the cytokines GM-CSF, G-CSF, and IL-6 allowed a rapid generation of MDSCs from precursors present in mouse and human bone marrow (BM). BM-MDSCs induced by GM-CSF+IL-6 possessed the highest tolerogenic activity, as revealed by the ability to impair the priming of CD8(+) T cells and allow long term acceptance of pancreatic islet allografts. Cytokines inducing MDSCs acted on a common molecular pathway and the immunoregulatory activity of both tumor-induced and BM-derived MDSCs was entirely dependent on the C/EBPbeta transcription factor. Adoptive transfer of tumor antigen-specific CD8(+) T lymphocytes resulted in therapy of established tumors only in mice lacking C/EBPbeta in the myeloid compartment, suggesting that C/EBPbeta is a critical regulator of the immunosuppressive environment created by growing cancers.
